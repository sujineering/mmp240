    <p> receipe info f you’re anything like us, your cooking changes season by season. When the weather gets cold, that means reaching for hearty ingredients and comforting recipes—especially ones that come together fast or with the help of a trusted kitchen gadget like your slow cooker or favorite skillet. We look forward to making some of our favorite dishes in the winter, from baked pastas and creamy risottos to pot pies and meal-worthy soups—and we’ve rounded up all our best recipe ideas here. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true classic to make for your family, start with Chicken Marsala. The secret to amazing flavor? Cook the mushrooms and prosciutto strips in the same skillet as the chicken. That way you can take advantage of the brown bits and caramelized pieces left behind.</p>
